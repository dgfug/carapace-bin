# v0.16 - Pandoras Box

![](./v0.16/banner.png)

Switched to a [custom pflag fork](https://github.com/carapace-sh/carapace-pflag) with adaptions for non-posix variants like long shorthands (e.g. `-shorthand`).

> So far this has been done by patching `os.Args` which was rather hacky.
Modifications to the flag parser are quite complex though, so there might be some issues.

see [#1293](https://github.com/carapace-sh/carapace-bin/pull/1293/files)

[Spec](https://github.com/carapace-sh/carapace-spec) files support non-posix flags now as well:

```yaml
flags:
  -np: non-posix shorthand
  -np, -nonposix:  non-posix shorthand and longhand
  -np, --nonposix: non-posix shorthand mixed with posix longhand
```
