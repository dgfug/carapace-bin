# v0.20 - Blinkers

![](./v0.20/banner.png)

### Export

Contains breaking changes on the [export](https://carapace-sh.github.io/carapace/carapace/export.html) format.
Since there is no backward compability any embedded external carapace based completion must be `>= v0.31.0`.


### Lenient

When environment variable `CARAPACE_LENIENT` is set (e.g. `export CARAPACE_LENIENT=1`) unknown flags are ignored.
Completers are supposed to be aware of all existing flags but can out of date or not yet working correctly.
This can be used to suppress the errors until issues are fixed.
