# v0.26 - Overly Attached Argument

![](./v0.26/banner.png)

## Argument

Added support for various attached versions of passing non-optional flag arguments:

```sh
--longhand=arg
-l=arg
-larg
-abclarg
```

## Lexer

Added a simple [lexer] for complex commands passed as single argument:

![](./v0.26/lexer.cast)

## Nushell

Used the [lexer] to patch arguments as these are currently passed mostly [unprocessed] to the completion function.
This is a workaround and has some edge cases but should overall improve the [Nushell] integration.
